This solution migrates MapKit to ArcGIS without code changes.

The solution uses swift 3 instead of Objective-C, now the class name cannot be `MKMapView`. Developers will need to rename `MKMapView` to `AGSMKMapView` including the view class name in the storyboard. 

## Requirements

* xCode 8 and above
* A little background with iPhone development and Swift
* Experience with the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](http://www.esri.com/) would help.
